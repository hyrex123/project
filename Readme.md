NFT Diplomas
Vision
The vision of the NFT Diplomas project is to revolutionize the way educational credentials are issued and verified. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to create a tamper-proof, transparent, and universally accessible system for issuing diplomas. This ensures that graduates can securely hold and share their academic achievements, and institutions can authenticate credentials with ease, reducing fraud and enhancing trust in the educational ecosystem.

Flowchart
Visual Representation
Here’s how you can arrange these steps in a flowchart tool:

Start 
Student Graduation 
Issue Diploma (Smart Contract) 
Store Diploma on Blockchain 
Graduate Receives NFT 
Verification Request
Verify Diploma on Blockchain 
Verification
Yes -> Verification Success
No -> Error/Fraud
End 

Student Graduation: The institution initiates the diploma issuance process upon student graduation.
Issue Diploma: The institution mints an NFT diploma using the smart contract and assigns it to the graduate’s wallet address.
Store Diploma: The NFT, containing the diploma details, is stored on the blockchain.
Verification: Employers or other institutions can verify the diploma by querying the blockchain using the token ID.
Graduate’s Access: The graduate can view, share, or transfer their NFT diploma as needed.

Smart Contract Overview
Contract Address
The NFT Diplomas smart contract is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract address is:

0xDe7C58D3e0fd6B6aCA5B63934F3EF1e762A8Cc43

Key Features
Issue Diploma: Authorized institutions can issue unique NFT diplomas to graduates.
View Diploma: Anyone can view diploma details by querying the contract with the token ID.
Immutable Records: Diplomas are stored on the blockchain, ensuring they cannot be altered or forged.
Future Scope
Multi-Institution Support: Expanding the platform to allow multiple educational institutions to issue diplomas through the same smart contract.
Integration with Job Portals: Enabling graduates to link their NFT diplomas directly to job portals for easier and verified credential sharing.
Mobile Application: Developing a mobile app that allows graduates to manage, display, and share their NFT diplomas conveniently.
Interoperability: Extending the system to support multiple blockchains, making it more accessible globally.
